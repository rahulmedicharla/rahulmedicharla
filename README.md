### About Me
Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rahul Medicharla, and I'm a student at the Ohio State University class of 2025.

I enjoy creating new products using new technologies, learning more about the field of computer science, and applying learned knowledge.   

I also enjoy participating in annual hackathons and developing my own side projects during my free time.

### Projects

<b>Hackathons</b>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/jackitaliano/Make23">Smart Notes</a> - A new voice to notes program that takes real-time lecture/meeting audio, transcribes the audio to text, and creates a summarized notes sheet with the most important information. In this project, I worked on the real-time audio input and transcription, as well as a voice activated TutorBot capable of answering any questions, and the basic output webpage with cloud functionality. This shows my improved usage of python, my understanding of multithreading by creating multiple processes to collect and parse audio files concurrently as well as improved cloud usage.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022">Audio Studio</a> - A new voice to code editor that takes conversational text, maps it to nested python code, and runs that code through voice commands. In this project, I developed the custom IDE that's able to output and run functional python code, and pull new code from the cloud. This shows my understanding of developing programs in the Model-View-Controller format and connecting programs to cloud for efficient data transferring.</p>

<b>Personal Projects</b>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/Bubble">Bubble</a> - A new mobile application that makes event organization between friends simple. This project shows my deep understanding of building dynamic applications using frameworks such as React and utilizing cloud features through Google Cloud Platform to achieve a multi user platform with real-time changing data.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/saffireFinal">Saffire</a> - A web application meant to keep student motivated during the pandemic. This project shows my initial experimentation of creating a dynamic web application</p>
