### About Me
Portfolio: https://rmedicharla.com

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rahul Medicharla, and I'm a student at the Ohio State University class of 2025.

I enjoy creating new products using new technologies, learning more about the field of computer science, and applying learned knowledge.   

I also enjoy participating in annual hackathons and developing my own side projects during my free time.

### Projects
<b>Personal Projects</b>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/evolate">evolate</a> - a custom data structure developed to address the problem of efficieny in search algorithms. evolate uses a custom trained Neural Network to autmatically identify and switch data structure implementations based on user behavioral patterns to maximize efficieny for the user. Utilizing a custom multi modal Node object, evolate seamlessly switches between Linked List, Hash Maps, Tree Maps, and Sequence implementations. This shows my understanding of data structures, the advantages and disadvantages of them, and my growing interest in data science and utilizing powerful machine learning prediction and inferencing models.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/mood.ai">mood.ai</a> - A new way of capturing memories and moments into AI generated art. Simply upload a short video clip and the program will run numerous ML models to decompose the video into its essential componenets. It then uses ChatGPT and Dalle-2 api's to recompose the moment in an artisitic manner. The repo linked is for a custom flask API I put on Google Cloud Run to allow the program to beu used. This shows my deep understanding of python and its object orientated style, utilizing ML models to parse important information, mutlithreading to improve efficiency, and using Docker to create and deploy a custom api<p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/Bubble">Bubble</a> - A new mobile application that makes event organization between friends simple. This project shows my deep understanding of building dynamic applications using frameworks such as React and utilizing cloud features through Google Cloud Platform to achieve a multi user 
platform with real-time changing data.</p>

<b>Hackathons</b>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/jackitaliano/Make23">Smart Notes</a> - A new voice to notes program that takes real-time lecture/meeting audio, transcribes the audio to text, and creates a summarized notes sheet with the most important information. In this project, I worked on the real-time audio input and transcription, as well as a voice activated TutorBot capable of answering any questions, and the basic output webpage with cloud functionality. This shows my improved usage of python, my understanding of multithreading by creating multiple processes to collect and parse audio files concurrently as well as improved cloud usage.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022">Audio Studio</a> - A new voice to code editor that takes conversational text, maps it to nested python code, and runs that code through voice commands. In this project, I developed the custom IDE that's able to output and run functional python code, and pull new code from the cloud. This shows my understanding of developing programs in the Model-View-Controller format and connecting programs to cloud for efficient data transferring.</p>
