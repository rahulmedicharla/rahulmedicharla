### About Me
Hey there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rahul Medicharla, and I'm a student at the Ohio State University class of 2025.

I enjoy creating new products using new technologies, learning more about the field of computer science, and applying learned knowledge.   

I also enjoy participating in annual hackathons and developing my own side projects during my free time.

### Projects
<b>Personal Projects</b>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/mood.ai">mood.ai</a> - A new way of capturing memories and moments into AI generated art. The program record a 5 second video and audio clip, and runs numerous ML models on the video and audio including object detection, emotion detection, speech recognition, sentiment analysis and more. These are used to generate AI generated art that encompasses the essence of the moment you would like to record and outputs them onto an AI gallery webpage. This shows my deep understanding of python and its object orientated style, utilizing ML models to parse important information, and mutlithreading to improve efficiency. <p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/Bubble">Bubble</a> - A new mobile application that makes event organization between friends simple. This project shows my deep understanding of building dynamic applications using frameworks such as React and utilizing cloud features through Google Cloud Platform to achieve a multi user 
platform with real-time changing data.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/SmartBrowser">Smart Browser</a> - A voice activated personal assisant browser. Gives personalized and unique answers based on use cases of academia, development, or assistant. The academia setting gives deep explanations about content and useful examples, the development setting gives working code with updated API's, and the assistant is for general uses. Built using Django and SQL. </p>

<b>Hackathons</b>
<p><a href = "https://github.com/jackitaliano/Make23">Smart Notes</a> - A new voice to notes program that takes real-time lecture/meeting audio, transcribes the audio to text, and creates a summarized notes sheet with the most important information. In this project, I worked on the real-time audio input and transcription, as well as a voice activated TutorBot capable of answering any questions, and the basic output webpage with cloud functionality. This shows my improved usage of python, my understanding of multithreading by creating multiple processes to collect and parse audio files concurrently as well as improved cloud usage.</p>

<p><a href = "https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022">Audio Studio</a> - A new voice to code editor that takes conversational text, maps it to nested python code, and runs that code through voice commands. In this project, I developed the custom IDE that's able to output and run functional python code, and pull new code from the cloud. This shows my understanding of developing programs in the Model-View-Controller format and connecting programs to cloud for efficient data transferring.</p>
